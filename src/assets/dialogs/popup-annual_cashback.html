            <u>Community Energy Network</u> – Every household will receive free solar panels on the roof of their home. This will instantly help generate power for the community and provide access to a lower energy tariff for residents.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>EarthSource</u> – The return in energy bill savings for EarthSource are so great that this product does not attract an annual cashback. In addition to a massively efficient system that delivers air conditioning, heating and hot water, the environmental benefits of this choice are compelling. If Earth Source is selected, Smart Air and Smart Water are not required.

        <p>
            <u>Smart Air</u> – we will pay you $100 every year to let us manage the speed of your air conditioner especially on hot days. You will still manage the temperature and if you want, we can even pre-cool your home so it is comfortable for you when you come home from work or ahead of the day's heat. We do this by installing a remote controller on your air conditioning unit, which gives us permission to adjust the speed of your air conditioner under conditions we've agreed with you.
        </p>

Iron out your petrol bills as well as your energy bills by moving ahead of the curve and installing an electric vehicle charging point.

In return, the community benefits as this product will help support the efficiency of the energy network.

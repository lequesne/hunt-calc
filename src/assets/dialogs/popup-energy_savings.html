            <u>Energy usage charges</u>
        </p>
        <p>
            Huntlee Plus's energy usage charges (tariffs) are designed to provide benefits, no matter what energy choices you make when living in the community.

            Fuel cost savings were calculated using an average 13,800kms driven per year (ABS - 9208.0 - Survey of Motor Vehicle Use, Australia, 12 months ended 31 October 2014), a fuel price of $1.20/litre and an average fuel consumption of 9litres/100km. Electric Vehicle consumption was assumed to be 20kWh/100km (Average of Tesla S and Nissan Leaf).

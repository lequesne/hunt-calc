			This Huntlee Plus energy calculator has been developed as an educational tool to help explain the potential benefits to homeowners of installing and using renewable energy in their home.
		</p>
		<p>
			The assumptions used to develop the comparative savings and benefits are detailed in the information tab in the results bar of the main screen. Published industry standards and independently modelled authoritative data has been used to develop the tool.
		</p>
		<p>
			It has been build with the support of a grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), focused on an offgrid renewable energy proposal being developed for the new community of Huntlee in the Hunter Valley. <a href="http://arena.gov.au/project/delivering-higher-renewable-penetration-in-new-land-and-housing-developments-through-off-grid-microgrids/" target="_blank" tabIndex="-1">http://arena.gov.au/project/delivering-higher-renewable-penetration-in-new-land-and-housing-developments-through-off-grid-microgrids/</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			This tool has not been designed as a basis for making financial decisions and giving market undertakings.

		    <strong>Carbon Savings</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		    We calculated the carbon savings using the Department of the Environment's National Greenhouse Accounts Factors.
		</p>
		<p>
		    To work out the CO2 comparison to fly around the equator we used the following numbers:
		</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>
		        CO2 Emissions from long haul airplane = 0.23kg/km (<a href="http://www.carbonplanet.com/downloads/Flight_Calculator_Information_v9.2.pdf" target="_blank" tabIndex="-1">http://www.carbonplanet.com/downloads/Flight_Calculator_Information_v9.2.pdf</a>)
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        Seats on a Boeing 747-400 = 416 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747" target="_blank" tabIndex="-1">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747</a>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        Average occupancy on a flight assumed = 80%
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        Distance around equator = 40,075km <a href="http://education.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/equator/" target="_blank" tabIndex="-1">http://education.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/equator/</a>
